## IPASS assignment
For the course IPASS in the first year of technical computer science at the university of utrecht an application with a library had to be made individually for a hardware module. At the beginning we did not use git and I found some spare time to upload this.

## library
For this course I recreated the game snake in C++ and wrote a library for an ssd1351 oled screen. To use this library hwlib and bmptk are needed. These can be found on [hwlib](https://github.com/wovo/hwlib) and [bmptk](https://github.com/wovo/bmptk)
